# Web infrastructure design

## Overview:

This repository contains documentation for various web infrastructure designs aimed at hosting the website www.foobar.com. Each design emphasizes different aspects such as simplicity, scalability, security, and high availability.

## Contents:

### Simple Web Stack

Design of a basic web infrastructure utilizing a single server with Nginx, MySQL, and application files.
Addresses issues such as single points of failure (SPOF) and limited scalability.

### Distributed Web Infrastructure

Design of a distributed web infrastructure using multiple servers with Nginx, HAProxy, MySQL, and application files.
Incorporates load balancing, high availability, and scalability measures.

### Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

Design of a secure and monitored web infrastructure featuring firewalls, SSL certificate, and monitoring clients.
Addresses security concerns and implements proactive monitoring for performance and security.

### Clustered Load Balancer Web Infrastructure

Design of a web infrastructure with a clustered load balancer (HAProxy), separate servers for each component, and HAProxy configured in a cluster.
Emphasizes fault tolerance, scalability, and load balancing
