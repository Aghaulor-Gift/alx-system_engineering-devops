# Postmortem: Nginx Outage on Web Application

![Postmortem]()
## Overview

This document details the postmortem analysis of the Nginx outage that affected our web application on June 1, 2024. It covers the issue summary, timeline of events, root cause analysis, resolution, and corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.

## Issue Summary

- **Duration of the Outage:**
  - **Start Time:** June 1, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
  - **End Time:** June 1, 2024, 11:30 AM UTC
- **Impact:**
  - The web application was completely inaccessible to users. Approximately 80% of users experienced downtime, with the remaining 20% facing significant slowdowns.
- **Root Cause:**
  - A spelling mistake in the Nginx configuration file caused the Nginx service to fail to start properly after a routine update.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM UTC:** Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating that the web application was unreachable.
- **10:05 AM UTC:** On-call engineer receives alert and begins investigation.
- **10:10 AM UTC:** Initial assumption: Network issue or server crash. Network diagnostics and server logs reviewed.
- **10:20 AM UTC:** Misleading path: Network infrastructure checked, found no issues. Server health metrics reviewed, all appeared normal.
- **10:30 AM UTC:** Escalation to the Nginx and Web Application teams for further investigation.
- **10:40 AM UTC:** Nginx team discovers the service is not running. Attempt to restart Nginx fails.
- **10:50 AM UTC:** Further inspection of Nginx configuration files reveals a spelling mistake in `nginx.conf`.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** Spelling mistake corrected in `nginx.conf`.
- **11:10 AM UTC:** Nginx service restarted successfully.
- **11:20 AM UTC:** Web application verified to be back online.
- **11:30 AM UTC:** Monitoring confirms full restoration of service.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause

The issue was caused by a spelling mistake in the Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`). During a routine update, the configuration line meant to specify the user was incorrectly typed as `usre nginx;` instead of `user nginx;`. This syntax error prevented Nginx from starting.

### Resolution

The error in the configuration file was identified and corrected. Specifically, the spelling mistake `usre nginx;` was corrected to `user nginx;`. After fixing the error, the Nginx service was successfully restarted, restoring access to the web application.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements

- Implement stricter validation and testing of configuration changes before deployment.
- Enhance monitoring to detect Nginx service failures more promptly.
- Improve the rollback process to quickly revert to the last known good configuration in case of issues.

### Tasks

1. **Patch Nginx Server:**
   - Update Nginx to the latest stable version with improved error handling.
2. **Add Configuration Validation:**
   - Implement automated syntax checking for `nginx.conf` and other critical configuration files before applying updates.
3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Add monitoring to specifically track the status of the Nginx service and alert on failures or anomalies.
4. **Improve Rollback Procedures:**
   - Develop and document a clear rollback procedure for configuration changes, ensuring rapid recovery from failures.
5. **Conduct Training:**
   - Provide training for the engineering team on best practices for configuration management and error prevention.
6. **Schedule Regular Audits:**
   - Conduct regular audits of configuration files to ensure compliance with best practices and prevent similar issues.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent recurrence of such outages and improve the overall reliability and resilience of our web application infrastructure.
